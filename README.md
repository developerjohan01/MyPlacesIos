# MyPlaces - iOS
Small iOS demo app that lets the user save places in a list (UITableView) by selecting and long pressing on a map

Showing how to:
 - add a location with a pin/annotation - *MapKit*
 - get the user location - *MapKit*
 - use a simple OK-Cancel-dialog and get a value - *UIAlertController*
 - segue from a table cell to a detail screen (the map) 
 - save data (the Places, only basic funtionality with 1 table) - *CoreData*
 
NOTE 
- this is **not** a best practices guide
